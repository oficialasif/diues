# Backend Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Connection Issues
- **Problem**: The Database class was not properly establishing connections when methods were called
- **Fix**: Modified the `getConnection()` method to cache the connection and updated all query methods to use `getConnection()` instead of directly accessing `$this->conn`

### 2. Missing Database Column
- **Problem**: The `users` table was missing the `is_active` column that the Auth class was trying to query
- **Fix**: Added the missing `is_active` column to the users table and set all existing users as active

### 3. Incorrect Admin Password
- **Problem**: The default admin password hash in the database didn't match the expected password 'admin123'
- **Fix**: Updated the admin password to 'admin123' with proper password hashing

## Current Admin Credentials

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: `admin`

## Files Modified

1. **`config/database.php`**
   - Fixed connection handling in query methods
   - Improved error handling

2. **`config/auth.php`**
   - No changes needed - was working correctly

3. **Database Schema**
   - Added missing `is_active` column to users table
   - Updated admin user password
